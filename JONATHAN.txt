Jonathan - 

I added what I think will solve our grouping and plotting issue. Take a look at the scenerios 2 notebook. I had to do a few different things to work around some issues that
came up but I think the solution works. I still have to functionalize the process and add it as a method to the HierarchyTree class. take a look at the norebook and let me
know what you think.

Also - We are still having that instability issue with the exponentiation. Thats why we are misclassifying that one point. It gets worse as the number of points grows...

I'm still thinking about this and hope to have a solution by tomorrow. I have a dinner tonight, but will text you when I'm back in durham tomorrow am.

Jonathan -

I was able to streamline a lot of the hypothesis testing and other helper function calls last night.

The biggest changes are in how the parameters are called into the hypothesis testing functions. The parameters dictionary is now pointed to by each Leaf/ Node object,
so all the information that we need to do calcs is entirely contained there. This means that every function can be called by just using `function(ci, cj)` instead of needing
additional arguments, formatting, etc.

Take a look at the tstBHC.py script. It uses everything we have so far as a single big test of all the functions and classes. Then take a look at the `Algo_Prototype_2` notebook. It is basically
the same thing but in notebook format so easier to experiment with. I have also started an xxArchive folder for our old notebooks. You will find the deprec notebook there in case
you need to reference it.

I think the next big thing we need to do is create the HierarchyTree class which you will find in the `Algo_Prototype_2` notebook towards the bottom. I have thought a little about how to
do this, but I'm not exactly sure where to start so let me know what you think. We should add the specifics of what we need to the scrum board. I realized that I made one several weeks ago
and then forgot about it. It's very broad and needs to be further refined. Feel free to add anything you can think of that we need to do still.

Lets discuss file system and stuff tomorrow. Shoot me a text/ slack msg when you read this.
